    "    A relative path refers to the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory. Relative paths are context-dependent, meaning they depend on where you are currently in the file system. They provide a way to specify locations without using the complete absolute path from the root directory."

    "    The shelve module is used for persistent storage of Python objects, such as dictionaries, lists, and other data structures. A \"shelf\" in Python is similar in concept to a dictionary. It resembles a dictionary because it allows you to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs. In fact, a shelf is often described as a \"persistent dictionary."
